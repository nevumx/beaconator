Beaconator
===========

by Nicholaos Mouzourakis

Created with Unity 2019.4.34f1. Inspired by https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19. To play the game or mess around with it, download an appropriate Unity version, open the folder in Unity, (if asked to upgrade the Asset Database, you may click Yes) open the MainScene, and the press the play button to play. The default input is my own, but you are welcome to change it in the `Scanner.cs` file.
